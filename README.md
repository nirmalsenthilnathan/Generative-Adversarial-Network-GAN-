# Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-
Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a classiﬁcation technique, which comprise of two portion as follows: a Generator and a Classiﬁer. 

Generator in the network, considers a random data and continuously tries to imitate the input data. the Classiﬁer in the network is trained to classify the original data from the generated data. Because of this continuous training between the generator and clas- siﬁer in GAN network, high accuracy rates can be obtained with less data samples.
